# Hi, I am Siddharth üëãüèª

I am a Software Engineer based in India.

- I started off my career as a Software Engineer and have experience working
  with backend, infrastructure and performance issues.
- I have experience in working with Nodejs, TypeScript, Arc.codes,
  Java, Rust, Nginx, PostgreSql,  GitHub Action, AWS services and Docker.
- Along the way, I developed an interest for lower level systems such as
  database system, storage engines, protocols, networking, observability and etc.
- Hence, I've decided to pivot my careers towards working on lower level
  systems.

To make that a reality, I spend most of my time reading reaserch papers, courses and reading codes
to become a better programmer along with its community.

- Currently learning about Rust, database system,  storage engines, network programming, distributed system and exploring the unknowns.
- Writing a [RedRusDB](https://github.com/RedRusDB/redrus) in Rust from scratch.
- Writing a [Non-Blocking Concurrent Data Structures](https://github.com/siddharth1729/nonblocking_datastructures) in Rust.
- Writing about how I implement a database system in Rust [RedRusDB Doc](https://redrusdb.github.io/.github).
- Learning about Rust, database system, network programming, distributed system and exploring the unknowns.

Outside of programming, I enjoy writing and sharing what I learned. You
can find out more about my writings at my [website][0].
